## Current Status

RANE is a functioning bootstrap compiler with:

- A minimal but real language surface
- Deterministic lowering and fixups
- A typed IR stage
- A working native x64 backend
- A prototype memory-band loader concept

Advanced features described in older documents are **planned**, not yet implemented.
